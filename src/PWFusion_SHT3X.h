 * 
 * Designed for use with with Playing With Fusion SHT31-DIS-B and SHT31-DIS-F
 * Humidity and Temperature Sensor Breakouts: SEN-37002
 *
 *   SEN-37002 (universal applications)
 *   ---> http://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?pdid=81 B, no filter
 *   ---> F, with filter
 *   Note: This will aslo work with other SHT3X sensors (SHT35, for instance)
 * 
 * Tested Platforms:
 * 
 * - Arduino Uno R3
 * - R3aktor M0 Logger 
 * 
 * @section min_ex Minimal Example
 * 
 * Here is a minimal example you can use to get running using a [R3aktor M0 logger](https://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?pdid=157&catid=1018):
 * ```cpp
 * #include "PWFusion_SHT3X.h"
 *
 * // Static variables
 * static PWFusion_SHT3X sht3 = {};
 *
 * void setup() {
 *   // Setup Serial
 *   Serial.begin(115200);
 *   while (!Serial) {;}
 *   Serial.println("Initialized serial");
 *
 *   // Setup SHT3X sensor (Playing With Fusion)
 *   if (!sht3.begin(SHT3X_ADDR_PRIMARY))
 *   {
 *     Serial.println("Failed to initialize temp/humidity sensor");
 *     while (1) {;}
 *   }
 *
 *   Serial.println("Initialization success");
 * }
 *
 * void loop() {
 *   // Measure sensor
 *   PWFusion_SHT3X_Data d = sht3.measure();
 *
 *   if (!d.wasError())
 *   {
 *     Serial.print("Temp (F): ");
 *     Serial.print(d.getTempF());
 *     Serial.print(" Temp (C): ");
 *     Serial.print(d.getTempC());
 *     Serial.print(" Humidity (%): ");
 *     Serial.println(d.getRelativeHumidity() * 100);
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *     Serial.println("Error trying to get data");
 *   }
 *
 *   delay(1000);
 * }
